# CS 3240: UniMap Website üìç

Welcome to the UniMap Repository üëã! Throughout the semester, our team has developed an application that aims to increase visibility regarding how busy locations are around Grounds. UniMap allows users to *Vote* on how busy a location is and view other users' rating. Users may request to add locations onto the public map by leveraging the *Create* feature. By incorporating Google Maps API, Team A-08 has successfully implemented an exciting Django-Heroku web application. Any questions regarding this project should be directed to the developers' emails.

## Features üîç
- **Vote**: Users may submit their vote indicating how busy a location is.
- **Graph**: The application will visually display how busy the location is, increasing visibility and general accessibility.
- **Create**: Users may suggest locations they want added to the Map. By submitting information, their suggestions will be reviewed by Admins for verification.
- **Verify**: Through the Admin settings, developers may approve suggested locations to be put onto the Map.
- **Deny Verification**: To prevent innapropriate behavior, Admins also have the ability to deny suggestions. This makes UniMap a safe and friendly application for all.
- **Edit Settings**: If a suggestion is on the right track, Admins may modify the information submitted and make it align with UniMap's standards.
- **Special Feature: 3-Hour Timer**: Much like YikYak, UniMap employs a timer. Every three hours, a user's vote will disappear. By doing this, students have an accurate idea of how busy a location is at the current time.

## Implications üí°

With its innovative features, UniMap opens up a number of possibilities for students, faculty, and visitors on Grounds. The application extends its primary function of gauging the busyness of a location, offering a range of implications around Grounds!

### Enhancing Productivity and Focus üìö
- **Academic Planning**: Students can strategically plan their study sessions by utilizing UniMap to find quiet and less crowded libraries or study spots, fostering an environment conducive to focused learning.
- **Workspace Selection**: For group projects or individual work, UniMap aids in choosing the ideal locations with the right balance of ambiance and occupancy.

### Grounds Exploration and Socialization üó∫Ô∏è
- **Going Out**: Planning a meet-up with friends? UniMap provides real-time insights into the atmosphere of bars, frats, cafes, and other social spaces, ensuring a lively experience.
- **Explore**: UniMap encourages exploration by helping users discover new buildings, scenic spots, and cozy corners on campus that may not be widely known.

### Fitness and Well-being üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- **Optimizing Gym Visits**: Fitness enthusiasts can utilize UniMap to check the current occupancy of the gym, ensuring they have a smooth workout experience without waiting for equipment.
- **Promoting Healthier Habits**: Students can make informed decisions about their daily routines, such as choosing less crowded dining areas or engaging in outdoor activities.

### 3-Hour Timer: Balancing Accuracy and Privacy ‚è±Ô∏è
- **Real-Time Accuracy**: The unique 3-hour timer feature ensures that UniMap reflects the current state of locations, providing accurate and up-to-date information for users. If a user tries to vote again during this period, their new vote will override their previously casted vote.
- **Privacy Considerations**: By automatically clearing votes after three hours, UniMap maintains user privacy and prevents outdated data from influencing decisions.
